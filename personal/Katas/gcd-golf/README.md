### Task
Implement Greatest Common Divisor Application to achieve the shortest possible source code.

Here is more information about Greatest Common Divisor [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)

### Example:

```
gcd(12, 4) == 4
gcd(4, 12) == 4

```

### Checking filesize

Please feel free to use any method to do this. But for those that want an
easy way, in the terminal type in ...

```
