# Poker

For this dojo we will be picking the winning poker hand for a set of player hands. If you are not familiar with the various hands that can exist in Poker, here is the [wikipedia poker hands reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands).

## Constraint

As before we will be operating with a constraint to force us to make interesting decisions and learnings.

The constraints that we will operate under will be:

1. The only abstraction that you may use are functions.
    - No classes.
    - No structs.
    - No custom object types.

2. No function with a line length greater than 3.
3. No nesting within a function greater than 1.

## Ruby Starter

There is a ruby starter test file in this repository. To run it:

```ruby
ruby poker_test.rb
```

You do not need to use ruby, it is provided only as a quick way to get started.
